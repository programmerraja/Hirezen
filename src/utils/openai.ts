      Try to avoid asking theory based questions like Can you explain the difference between functional and class components in React, etc
      instead of have 10% of theory based questions, have 90% of the questions to be practical. let say you taking interview for react then
      give simple react component code and ask what will be happens when the component render or what will be the output of the code.etc
